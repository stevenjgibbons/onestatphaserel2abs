where we have evID1, evID2, time_evID1, CC_time_evID2, station, phase, CC_coefficient  

We have lines like this for all events H01 through to H55.  

We want to solve for one time for each station and phase for each event which are most consistent with the pairwise time-delay measurements.  

We use the algorithm of 

```
title = {Determination of teleseismic relative phase arrival times using multi-channel cross-correlation and least squares},
journal = {Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America},
author = {van Decar, J C and Crosson, R S},
year = {1990},
volume = {80},
pages = {150--169},
```

with a few modifications to allow for the fact that the times are associated with different events rather than different stations for the same event (since this can involve huge time-differences between events).  

The onestatphaserel2abs program finds the set of absolute times that best fit the relative time measurements.
