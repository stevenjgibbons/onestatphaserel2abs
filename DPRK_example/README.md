The file DPRK_allcctimes.txt contains relative time delay measurements between seismic signals from the first five underground nuclear tests published in Gibbons et al. (2017) (https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw379).  

There are in addition new measurements made from open seismic data, data obtained from the DTRA Waveforms From Nuclear Explosions website (https://www.wfne.info/), and data from the HINET network in Japan for all of the 6 underground nuclear explosions between 2006 and 2017.
